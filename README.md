# IEOR 4579 Machine Learning in Practice â€“ Final Project
## Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis

Authors: Ziad El Assal, Youssef Lahlou, Lorenzo Rega

Forked from Pouya Rezazadeh Kalehbasti's repository

We reproduce the results of Kalehbast et al., extend using demographic and socio-economic features and conduct a robustness analysis on the models used. 
Although we slightly modified `data_cleanup.py and `data_preprocessing.py`, most of our code is in the following notebooks:
- `data_cleanup.ipynb` joins the new dataset to the original one,
- `run_models.ipynb` runs the models using the enhanced dataset and statistical significance of the metrics, 
- `robustness.ipynb` contains the robustness analysis.

The new dataset can be found at http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/geoportal/resources/nyc_geog/nyc_zcta_census_data.xlsx

In order to run the code make sure you pre-instal all the dependecies such as
TextBlob and sklearn

+ DOWNLOAD THE DATASET:

Create a directory called "Data", and download the datasets from this link into the directory:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xk5RyR-UgF6M-ddhn11SXHEWJeB0fQo5?usp=sharing


+ INITIAL DATA PREPROCESSING:
1. Generate a fine with review sentiment: `python sentiment_analysis.py`
2. Clean the data: `python data_cleanup.py`
3. Normalize and split the data: `data_preprocessing_reviews.py`

+ GENERATE THE FEATURE SELECTION .NPY FILE:
1. For P-value feature selection: `python feature_selection.py`
2. For Lasso CV: `python cv.py`

+ TRAIN AND RUN THE MODELS:
`python run_models.py`
Note that by commenting/uncommenting certain lines of code you will be able to
run different configurations of the models.
1. To run the models with Lasso CV feature selection comment out line 240
`coeffs = np.load('../Data/selected_coefs_pvals.npy')` and uncomment line 241
`coeffs = np.load('../Data/selected_coefs.npy')`.
2. To run the models with p-value feature selection uncomment line 240
`coeffs = np.load('../Data/selected_coefs_pvals.npy')` and comment out line 241
`coeffs = np.load('../Data/selected_coefs.npy')`.
3. To run the baseline uncomment the lines 277, 278
```python
    print("--------------------Linear Regression--------------------")
    LinearModel(X_concat, y_concat, X_test, y_test)
 ```
 and comment out everything below these lines. Also, comment out the lines 268, 269 and 270
 ```python
    X_train = X_train[list(col_set)]
    X_val = X_val[list(col_set)]
    X_test = X_test[list(col_set)]
 ```

Warning: certain models take a while to train and run!
